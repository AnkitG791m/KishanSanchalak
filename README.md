KishanSanchalak
AI-Powered Offline-First Farmer Support Platform

KishanSanchalak is a technology-driven agriculture support platform designed to solve real problems faced by farmers in rural and low-connectivity areas. The system works even without internet access or smartphones and focuses on farmer safety, fair income, and digital inclusion.

Being a farmer’s son, the idea is built from lived experience and ground reality, not assumptions.

Problem Statement

Farmers face multiple challenges in daily agricultural activities. Most farmers do not have access to high-end smartphones, stable internet, or continuous electricity. Identifying crop diseases correctly is difficult, which often leads to wrong treatment and crop loss. Fake or unsuitable medicines are commonly sold, causing further damage. Natural disasters such as floods, heatwaves, and storms arrive without warning. During crop selling, middlemen exploit farmers by offering unfair prices. In addition, workers are often unavailable during peak farming seasons, and many farmers miss government subsidies due to lack of information.
